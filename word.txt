1.  To find out total combination we just multiply the number of faces on 
    first dice with number of faces on another dice.
     here each dice contains 6 faces and there are two dice. So each face combine
      with 6 faces of other dice.
       Mathematically, Dice A's 1 combines with Dice B,s 1,2,3,4,5,6.
     Dice A's 2 combines with Dice B,s 1,2,3,4,5,6.
     Similarly this combination form with 3,4,5,6 of dice A with dice B.
     Total combination we get is (6*6) =36.

2.  To display combination value we have to find the sum of each combination.
   Mathematically, Dice A value=1 and Dice B value=1. So combination is   1+1=2.
  Similarly we have to find all the combination values.For that we use to with a 
   loop and find the combine value and then display it.    

 3.   to find probability of sum of each time here first I found 
     the sum then it'sfrequency using Hashmap. And then simply using 
      the probability formula on each value .
      Important::  We can make thevalue upto a certain decimal point but in question it is not mentioned but
       if you guys want to transform the decimal value upto a certain point like 2numbers or 3 numbers after decimal we can
       achieve through decimal format or by using brute-force way. 
      
 4. to find out the spots on dice without effecting the probability of the sum of each time,  
   for that   we go with two steps first if spots are less than 4 we can assign
   the values in newdieA else we check if value present or count already in the
   map or if it'scount is smaller than 4 we put on dieA and check it's occurence .
